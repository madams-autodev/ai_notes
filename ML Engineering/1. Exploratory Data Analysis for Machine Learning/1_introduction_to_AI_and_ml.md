*Artificial Intelligence (AI)* → Broadest concept; machines that mimic intelligent behavior.

*Machine Learning (ML)* → Subset of AI; systems that learn from data instead of being explicitly programmed.

*Deep Learning (DL)* → Subset of ML; uses multi-layered neural networks to handle complex tasks like vision and language.

Think of it as: AI ⊇ ML ⊇ DL



# Why Deep Learning Matters

Traditional ML struggled with:
  * Extracting useful features in images.
  * Handling language complexities like grammar & word order.

DL breakthroughs:
  * Image classification: since \~2015, models outperform humans on benchmarks.
  * Machine translation: near-human translations, accounting for ordering, phrasing, context.



# Drivers of Today’s AI Boom

1. *Data availability* → massive amounts from social media, sensors, healthcare, etc.
2. *Compute power* → GPUs, TPUs, and distributed systems.
3. *Storage innovations* → cheaper, scalable infrastructure.



# Applications of AI

* Advertising → targeted marketing.
* Retail → supply chain optimization.
* Transportation → self-driving cars.
* Smart homes → voice assistants, automation.
* Healthcare, finance, security → predictive analytics, fraud detection, diagnostics.



# Example outside ML/DL

Rule-based systems = AI but not ML/DL.
  * E.g., “If X happens, do Y.”
  * No learning from new data.
