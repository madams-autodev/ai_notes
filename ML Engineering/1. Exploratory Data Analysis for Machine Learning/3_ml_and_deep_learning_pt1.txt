Let's dive into what we
mean by Machine Learning. Machine Learning is the
study and construction of programs that are not
explicitly programmed, but rather learn patterns as they're exposed to
more data over time. So as we saw earlier, Machine Learning is going to be a subset of Artificial
Intelligence. It's going to be a subset that's going to learn from
observing data. The more data, the better the algorithm is able to learn
the underlying patterns. I do want to note that the performance of these
algorithms will plateau. So there will be a
sense of diminishing returns after certain
amount of data. But in general, the
idea is going to be that as we gain more data, Machine Learning is
going to be able to better understand the
underlying patterns. So these programs learn
from repeatedly seeing data rather than being
explicitly programmed by humans. So it's not going to be a
set of rules programmed by humans in order
to make a decision. So as an example, let's say we're
working with trying to decide whether emails
are spam or not spam. We would start off with
a dataset where we have a bunch of emails
that are going to be labeled spam versus not spam. These emails will be
preprocessed and fed through a Machine Learning
algorithm that learns the patterns for spam
versus not spam, and the more emails
it has to learn the underlying patterns the better the model is going to get. Once the machine algorithm
is trained we can then use it to predict as new
emails are coming in. So we trained on
this label dataset, and now we can run in production
and as new emails come in we can predict
spam versus not spam. So we're going to use this simple dataset here just to highlight what features are and
what a target is. Features and target
are going to be important terms for
us to understand. So don't get distracted
by the data itself as the main purpose of this slide is just to help
define these terms. This iris dataset is
a popular dataset often used to introduce basic concepts in Machine Learning. But we will move to more realistic complex datasets as we work through the course. So the iris here is going
to be a flower that comes in three species as you
see here: virginica, setosa, and
versicolor, and that's going to be the target that
we're trying to predict. So our dataset here
contains four features, sepal length, and sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Those are going to be
the features we will use to make our prediction. Then again as I mentioned before, the target variable
is going to be the column that we're
trying to predict. The idea is to use
the four features, sepal length, sepal
width, petal length, and petal width in order to predict the species and
then moving forward if we had those four
features we would be able to predict the
species without the label. So in general there are two
types of Machine Learning. There are supervised learning
and unsupervised learning. Let's first go over the type of datasets that each
is going to need. For supervised learning, we will have a target column or labels similar to what we just saw with the email spam and iris flower
classification examples, and then for
unsupervised learning on the other hand we will
not have a target column. How this comes into
play will make more sense in just a second. So let's discuss
the goals of each supervised and
unsupervised learning. The goal for
supervised learning is going to be able to
predict that label. Is it spam or is it not spam? Is it's versicolor or another one of the
different flower species? For unsupervised learning,
the goal is going to be to find an underlying structure of the dataset
without any labels, and this will be clear
with our examples. An example of supervised
learning is fraud detection. We may have a large dataset
where we have labels of either this transaction is fraud and this
transaction is not fraud. We would learn from
all the features related to fraud
detection and be able to predict as new credit
card transactions come in whether those
are fraud or not fraud. For unsupervised
learning, an example would be customer segmentation. For this, you can think about customer segmentation to find similar groupings
within your dataset for a marketing campaign, you have this e-commerce data and you want to separate them out into groups in order to
target them accordingly. For unsupervised learning, there's going to be no
right or wrong answer. So the user will need to
test different models and see which results tend
to make the most sense. We'll get into this we have
an entire lecture where we discuss different algorithms and techniques found to
accomplish this task. So suppose you wanted to identify fraudulent credit
card transactions, detecting fraud is going to be a common Machine
Learning problem, You can define your features
to be transaction time, transaction amounts, transaction location,
category of purchase. Combining all of these
features together, we should be able to predict in the future with transaction time, the amount location in
the category of purchase, whether there's unusual activity, and whether this transaction
is fraud versus not fraud. Generally speaking, this
structured data with intuitive features
are going to be a good task for our
traditional Machine Learning.
