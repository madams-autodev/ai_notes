# What is Generative AI?
**Definition**: Generative AI = Deep learning models that **create new content** (text, images, audio, 3D objects, music) based on the data they were trained on.
* Think of it as an **artist**: it studies many examples, learns the patterns, and then creates *original* work inspired by them.


# Types of Generative AI Models

1. Text Generation
Learns relationships between words & phrases → generates contextually correct text.
Examples:
  * Continue writing a story when you start the first few lines.
  * Translate text from English → Spanish while preserving meaning & tone.
**Model Example**: GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer).


2. Image Generation

Two main approaches:

* **Text → Image**: Turn prompts into pictures.

  * *Example*: “A robot playing a piano” → AI draws it.
  * Model: **DALL·E**.

* **Image → Image / Random seed → Image**: Use an existing image as input, or noise, and generate variations.

  * *Example*: Start with a sky photo → AI creates artistic renditions.
  * Applications:
    * 🖌️ Turn sketches → realistic images
    * 🎭 Deepfakes (actors brought back digitally)
  * Models: **GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks)**, **Diffusion models**

3. Audio Generation
* Generates natural-sounding speech or music.
* **Example**: Turn text into realistic voices (text-to-speech).
* Model Example: **WaveNet**.
