# Why Convert Words to Numbers?
- Neural networks **can’t understand raw text** like "cat" or "dog".  
- We need to **turn words into numbers (features)** so the model can learn patterns.  
- Example task: Classify emails → Does it talk about cats, dogs, or hippos?



## One-Hot Encoding
- Each **word = a vector** with:
  - **0s everywhere** 
  - **1 at the position of that word** 
- Vocabulary example: `[I, like, cats, hate, dogs, hippos]`
  - "I" → `[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
  - "like" → `[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
  - "cats" → `[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]`

Problem: If vocab = 10,000 words → each vector = 10,000 dimensions (huge & sparse).



## Bag of Words (BoW)
- Represents a **whole sentence/document** by **adding up one-hot vectors**.  
- Example: `"I like cats"`  

  I      = \[1,0,0,0,0,0]
  like   = \[0,1,0,0,0,0]
  cats   = \[0,0,1,0,0,0]
-----------------------

BoW    = \[1,1,1,0,0,0]

- Captures **which words appeared**, but ❌ **loses word order** ("cats like I" looks the same).

---

## Embeddings
- A **smarter alternative** to one-hot encoding.  
- Instead of huge sparse vectors, each word = **dense vector** of smaller size (e.g. 50, 100, 300 dimensions).  
- Embeddings are **learned during training**.  
- Example (tiny 3D embeddings):  
```

"cat" → \[0.2, -0.7, 0.9]
"dog" → \[0.3, -0.6, 0.8]
"hippo" → \[-0.4, 0.1, 0.5]

````
👉 Similar words have **similar vectors** (cat & dog are closer than cat & hippo).



## 5. 🛠️ Embedding Matrix
- Imagine a **table**:
- Rows = words in vocab.  
- Columns = embedding dimensions.  
- Example: If vocab = 6 words, embedding_dim = 4 → matrix = `6 x 4`.

- Instead of looking up a **giant one-hot vector**, we just pick the row = embedding vector.

---

## Embedding Bag
- Bag of Words but using **embeddings instead of one-hot**.  
- Input: Token indexes `[I, like, cats]`.  
- Output: **Sum or average of their embeddings**.  
- Saves time: instead of manually adding embeddings → `nn.EmbeddingBag` does it directly.

## 7. ⚡ Using in PyTorch

### Step 1: Create Embedding


```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# vocab_size = number of unique words
# embedding_dim = size of each word vector

embedding = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)

# Example: "I like cats" → [0, 1, 2]
input_ids = torch.tensor([0, 1, 2])
embeds = embedding(input_ids)
print(embeds.shape)  # (3, embedding_dim)
````

### Step 2: Create EmbeddingBag

```python
embedding_bag = nn.EmbeddingBag(vocab_size, embedding_dim, mode='mean')

# Sentence indices
input_ids = torch.tensor([0, 1, 2])
offsets = torch.tensor([0])  # first doc starts at 0

bag = embedding_bag(input_ids, offsets)
print(bag.shape)  # (1, embedding_dim)
```

👉 Instead of embeddings for each word, you get **one vector for the whole sentence**.

## 8. 🔑 Key Takeaways

* **One-Hot Encoding** = simple, high-dimensional, no similarity info.
* **Bag of Words** = represents sentences, but ignores order/context.
* **Embeddings** = compact vectors, capture meaning, trainable.
* **Embedding Bag** = sums/averages embeddings → efficient for documents.
* PyTorch provides `nn.Embedding` & `nn.EmbeddingBag` for this.

---

💡 **Analogy**:

* One-hot = giving each student their own locker (big space, mostly empty).
* Embeddings = students grouped into dorm rooms by similarity (efficient & meaningful).

```

---

👉 Do you want me to also draw a **visual diagram (tables & arrows)** for:  
- One-hot vs Bag of Words vs Embedding → so you can *see* the difference clearly?
```


Perfect question 👌 — this is the heart of **NLP feature engineering**. Let’s break it down in **dummy-friendly terms** so you can decide *when to use what* depending on your task.

---

## 🔠 1. **One-Hot Encoding**

* Each word gets a unique vector where only one element is “1” and the rest are “0.”
* Example:

  * "cat" → \[1,0,0,0]
  * "dog" → \[0,1,0,0]

✅ **When to use:**

* Very simple tasks.
* Small vocabularies (like toy problems or beginner projects).
  ❌ **Why not always:**
* Doesn’t capture meaning → “cat” and “dog” are as unrelated as “cat” and “banana.”
* Vectors get huge if vocab is large.

**Use case**: Spam detection on a small dataset (words like *free, win, money*).

---

## 📊 2. **Bag of Words (BoW)**

* Counts how often each word appears in a document.
* Example:

  * Sentence: “AI is fun, AI is powerful.”
  * Features: {AI:2, is:2, fun:1, powerful:1}

✅ **When to use:**

* Simple classification tasks where **frequency** matters.
* Works fine when **word order is not important**.
  ❌ **Why not always:**
* Still doesn’t understand context (“dog bites man” = “man bites dog”).

**Use case**: Sentiment analysis (positive vs negative reviews).

---

## 🧮 3. **TF-IDF (Term Frequency – Inverse Document Frequency)**

* Like BoW, but it **reduces the weight of common words** (like *the, is*) and highlights unique ones.
* Example: In a corpus, *“machine learning”* might stand out more than *“the.”*

✅ **When to use:**

* Document classification, search engines (where rare keywords matter).
  ❌ **Why not always:**
* Still ignores word order and context.

**Use case**: Google search ranking → highlighting documents with rare but important words.

---

## 🧩 4. **Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText)**

* Words are mapped to vectors where **similar words are close together**.
* Example: “king” - “man” + “woman” ≈ “queen.”

✅ **When to use:**

* When **semantic meaning** matters.
* Tasks like text similarity, sentiment, translation.
  ❌ **Why not always:**
* Pretrained embeddings may miss new slang/jargon.

**Use case**: Chatbots, recommendation systems, detecting semantic similarity (“good” ≈ “great”).

---

## 🧠 5. **Contextual Embeddings (BERT, GPT, etc.)**

* Word meaning depends on context.
* Example:

  * “I went to the **bank** to deposit money.”
  * “I sat by the **bank** of the river.”
    → “bank” has different embeddings depending on sentence.

✅ **When to use:**

* Advanced NLP tasks needing deep understanding of context.
* Question answering, summarization, translation, etc.
  ❌ **Why not always:**
* Computationally expensive.
* Needs lots of resources.

**Use case**: Virtual assistants (Alexa, Siri), ChatGPT, legal/medical document analysis.

---

## 🎯 Rule of Thumb for Choosing

* **Small/simple problem** → One-Hot or BoW.
* **Keyword importance** → TF-IDF.
* **Meaning/relationships between words** → Word2Vec/GloVe/FastText.
* **Deep context understanding (state-of-the-art NLP)** → Transformers (BERT, GPT).

---

👉 Think of it like levels:

* One-hot/BoW = 🍼 baby steps.
* TF-IDF = 📊 teenager (smarter with keywords).
* Word Embeddings = 🎓 college (understands meaning).
* BERT/GPT = 🧠 PhD (understands meaning *and* context).
