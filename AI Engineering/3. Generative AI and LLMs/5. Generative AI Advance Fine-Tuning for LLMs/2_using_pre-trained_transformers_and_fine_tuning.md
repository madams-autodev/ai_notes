# Why Pre-Trained Transformers?

* Models like **BERT, GPT, LLaMA** are **pre-trained** on massive text datasets.
* They learn **general language patterns** → which can be reused for many tasks.
* Training from scratch = 🔥 **very expensive** (GPUs, weeks/months, \$\$\$).
* Pre-trained models = 🚀 **faster, cheaper, and more effective**.

## 🔹 What is Fine-Tuning?

Adapting a **pre-trained model** to a **specific task or domain** by continuing training with smaller, task-specific data.

✅ **Benefits:**

* Saves time + compute (no retraining from scratch).
* Works even with small labeled datasets.
* Customizes outputs for your domain (e.g., medical, finance).
* Improves accuracy on task-specific objectives.

## 🔹 Challenges to Watch Out For

* **Overfitting** → too small dataset or training too long.
* **Underfitting** → model not learning enough (bad learning rate/training setup).
* **Catastrophic Forgetting** → model loses general knowledge if overly tuned.
* **Data Leakage** → don’t mix training & validation data.

## 🔹 Approaches to Fine-Tuning

1. **Self-Supervised Fine-Tuning**

   * Model predicts missing/next words (like masked language modeling).
   * Uses unlabeled data.

2. **Supervised Fine-Tuning**

   * Uses **labeled task-specific data**.
   * Example: sentiment analysis → \[text, label].

   👉 Two strategies:

   * **Full fine-tuning** → update **all parameters**.
   * **PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning)** → only update a small subset (e.g., LoRA, adapters).

3. **Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF)**

   * Model learns from **human feedback** (preferred vs. not preferred outputs).
   * Used in **ChatGPT**.

4. **DPO (Direct Preference Optimization)**

   * Newer method.
   * Directly aligns model outputs with human preferences.
   * ✅ Simpler, faster, no reward model needed.

## 🔹 Analogy 📝

Think of pre-trained transformers like **a student who has read every book in the library** 📚.

* Fine-tuning = teaching that student **a specialized course** (e.g., “law” or “medicine”).
* Full fine-tuning = retraining the whole brain 🧠.
* PEFT = just teaching **a few new tricks** without overwriting everything.
* RLHF/DPO = letting humans **guide the answers** by saying “this is better.”

👉 Would you like me to also **map fine-tuning approaches to real-world tasks** (like which one you’d use for sentiment analysis, question answering, chatbots, etc.)? That way you can see **when to use what**.
