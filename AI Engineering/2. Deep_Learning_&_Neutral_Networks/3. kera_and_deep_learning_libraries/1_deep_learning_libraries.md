# Popular Deep Learning Libraries
In order of popularity:
1. TensorFlow  
2. PyTorch  
3. Keras  
* (Older library: Theano → now outdated)  


## 1. TensorFlow
- Developed by Google, released in 2015.  
- Most widely used in production (real-world applications).  
- Huge community → lots of tutorials, support, pre-trained models.  
- Still actively used by Google for research & products.  

✅ Best for: Deploying models at scale (apps, products, cloud).  
❌ Steeper learning curve (more code needed compared to Keras).  



## 2. PyTorch
- Developed by Facebook (Meta), released in 2016.  
- Based on Torch framework but rewritten in Python → feels natural & fast.  
- Extremely popular in academic research.  
- Great for custom experiments (when you need flexibility in model design).  

✅ Best for: Research, experimentation, flexible model building.  
❌ Like TensorFlow, also has a steep learning curve.  


## 3. Keras
- A high-level API (simplifies deep learning coding).  
- Runs on top of TensorFlow (uses TensorFlow as the backend).  
- Very beginner-friendly: You can build a full neural network in a few lines of code.  
- Supported by Google.  

✅ Best for: Beginners & fast prototyping.  
❌ Less control compared to PyTorch/TensorFlow.  



Analogy:
- Keras = Automatic car (easy, fast, beginner-friendly).  
- PyTorch = Manual car (more control, used by experts).  
- TensorFlow = Truck (heavy-duty, production-ready).
