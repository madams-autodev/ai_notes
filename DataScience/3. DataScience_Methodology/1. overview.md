<!-- Data Science Methodology Questions -->
1. Business Understanding: What is the problem that you are trying to solve?
2. Analytic approach: How can you use data to answer the business question?
3. Data requirements: What data do you need to answer the question?
4. Data Collection: Where is the data sourced from, and how will you receive the data?
5. Data Understanding: Does the data you collected represent the problem to be solved?
6. Data preparation: What additional work is required to manipulate and work with the data?
7. Modeling: When you apply data visualizations,do you see answers that address the business problem?
8. Evaluation: Does the data model answer the initial businedd question,or must you adjust the data?
9. Deployment: Can you put the model into practice?
10. Feedback: Can you get constructive feedback from the data and the stakeholders to answer the business question?


<!-- Business Understanding -->
1. Clearly defining the question is vital as it guides the analytic approach.
2. Understanding the goal of the person asking the question is crucial in establishing a clearly defined question
3. Objectives that support the goal should be identified to priotize and plan for problem solving
4. Engagement of different stakeholders is vital to determine requirements and clarify questions

<!-- Analytic approach -->
1. Identifying what type of patterns will be needed to address the question most effectively
2. Different types of patterns and relationships in data require different approaches to effectively address the questions being asked


<!-- Analytic Approach Based on the Question Type -->
1. Descriptive Questions: “What is the current status?”
Approach: Descriptive Analytics

Question:  "What is the current status of our sales?"  

Techniques:

Data aggregation: Combining data from various sources into a unified view.

Data mining: Extracting useful information from large datasets.

Data visualization: Using visual tools to present data in an easily understandable format.

Examples:

Summarizing sales data

Creating dashboards

Generating reports


2. Diagnostic Questions: “Why did it happen?”
Approach: Diagnostic Analytics

Question: "Why did our sales decline in the last quarter?"  

Techniques:

Drill-down: Exploring detailed data to find underlying causes.

Data discovery: Identifying patterns and relationships in data.

Correlation analysis: Assessing the relationship between different variables.

Examples:

Identifying root causes of sales decline

Analyzing customer complaints

Understanding failure points in a process


3. Predictive Questions: “What is likely to happen?”
Approach: Predictive Analytics

Question: "What is our sales forecast for the next year?"  

Techniques:

Regression analysis: Predicting outcomes based on relationships between variables.

Time series forecasting: Predicting future values based on past trends.

Machine learning models: Using algorithms to predict future outcomes based on historical data.

Examples:

Forecasting sales

Predicting customer churn

Estimating future demand


4. Prescriptive Questions: “What should we do?”
Approach: Prescriptive Analytics

Question: "What should we do to increase website traffic?"  

Techniques:

Optimization models: Finding the best solution from a set of alternatives.

Simulation: Modeling scenarios to predict outcomes.

Decision analysis: Evaluating and comparing different decisions.

Examples:

Recommending inventory levels

Optimizing marketing campaigns

Determining pricing strategies


5. Classification Questions: “Which category does this belong to?”
Approach: Classification (Supervised Learning)

Question: "Which category does this data point belong to?"   

Techniques:

Logistic regression: Predicting the probability of a categorical outcome.

Decision trees: Splitting data into branches to classify it.

Support vector machines: Finding the best boundary to separate categories.

Neural networks: Using interconnected nodes to classify data.

Examples:

Email spam detection

Image classification

Disease diagnosis


Understanding these different types of questions and the corresponding analytic approaches can help you unlock your data's true potential.
